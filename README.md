Missing value replacement, statistics calculation, and plotting

1) Replace the missing values using one of the methods we have discussed in the lecture hour. 
2) Calculate the mean, standard deviation, mode, and skewness of all numerical attributes and report them.
3) Find the most frequent value of each categorical variable.
4) Plot the probability distribution of both continuous and random variables.
5) Using “academic-emphasis” attribute as the class variable, plot the scatter plots of each pair of attributes. 
6) Compute the distance matrix using Euclidean distance.
7) Compute the distance matrix using Mahalonobis distance.
8) Choose one of thediscretization methods we have discussed in the lecture and discretize all numerical attributes using that method.
